It appears as though hours per week are stacked around the typical 40-hour value, and that this value of weekly hours dominates regardless of the level of education. However, it seems that it is somewhat less typical for people with lower levels of formal education to be working over 65 hours a week."

    "1. Based on what you have learned in this unit, try to interpret what you have discovered about the relationships between the features and the label in this exercise. Are the top two correlated features strongly or weakly correlated with the label? What about the remaining features? Are the two features strongly or weakly correlated with each other? Based on these answers, do these features seem appropriate to use for our machine learning problem? Are there other considerations that should be taken when selecting features for this problem (e.g. selecting different data, removing/adding features)?\n",

    "2. Inspect the data in your data matrix. Describe other feature engineering techniques that should be used to make the data suitable for modeling.\n",

    "1. Upon examining the correlation between features and the target label, it is evident that the top two correlated features exhibit only a weak correlation with the label. Most features have low correlation coefficients, indicating a lack of direct correlation with the label. However, the feature education_num shows a high correlation with education_years, suggesting a strong relationship between these two variables. The features capital-gain and hours-per-week are weakly correlated, with a correlation coefficient of 0.498%. Given these observations, most features appear unsuitable for our machine learning problem due to their low correlation coefficients. Specifically, fnlwgt, capital-loss, and age should be removed as their correlation coefficients are lower than 1%. On the other hand, education_num emerges as a promising feature for predicting education_years due to its high correlation. Additionally, we could consider adding major as a feature to explore if different majors influence the length of education years.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. To handle categorical variables, we should employ the one-hot encoding technique. However, it's important to avoid creating a highly complex matrix, especially since some features in the dataset have numerous unique values. Features such as sex_selfID, marital-status, and income are suitable for one-hot encoding due to their limited unique values, ensuring that the data matrix remains manageable. For other categorical variables with high complexity, we need to devise strategies to reduce their complexity before applying one-hot encoding. For instance, we can simplify the education feature by categorizing it into broader levels such as elementary school, middle school, high school, and college. Once simplified, we can then apply one-hot encoding to this feature. Additionally, for numerical features like capital-gain, which appears to have an exponential distribution, we should consider using log scaling and binning techniques to normalize the data. Appropriate scaling techniques should also be applied to other numerical features to ensure they are properly normalized for our machine learning models."
